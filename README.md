# KATscrape

KATscrape was originally developed as a Python script by Basil Ajith while he was practising in Trivandrum, appearing in KAT quite frequently. It was developed to parse through a day's cause list and identify how many cases his office had to attend on that day.

The simple Python script has now been developed into a web app; written in PHP. However, the current version is only in the 'beta' stage and a lot more features are yet to be added to the application.
