## KATscrape

KATscrape was originally developed as a Python script while I was practising in Trivandrum, appearing in [KAT](https://keralaadministrativetribunal.gov.in/main/home/) quite frequently. It was developed to search through a day's cause list and identify how many cases my office had to attend on that day.

The simple Python script has now been developed into a web app; written in PHP. However, the current version is only in the 'beta' stage and a lot more features are yet to be added to the application.
