## KATscrape

KATscrape was originally developed as a [Python script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60760222/how-can-i-interact-with-a-python-script-through-a-web-page) while I was practising in Trivandrum, appearing in [KAT](https://keralaadministrativetribunal.gov.in/main/home/) quite frequently. It was developed to search through a day's cause list and identify how many cases my office had to attend on that day. The Python script was developed into a web app, during the COVID-19 lockdown period, in PHP.

I've now abandoned this project.
